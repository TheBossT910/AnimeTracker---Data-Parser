# AnimeTracker - Data Parser
This code is meant to collect Anime data from different sources and import them into Firebase. 
* Currently I am only using AniList API

**PLAN**
* Get show general data
* Get show files (image URLs)
* Get air times
* Be able to create a new Firebase entry if the show does not exist yet
